{-| Represents whether the Media Element is an HTMLAudioElement or HTMLVideoElement,
NOT where the file is an audio or video file. Audio files play in video elements
and vice-versa.
-}
type MediaType
    = Audio
    | Video


{-| Represents an error in loading or playing the file, produced by the HTMLMediaElement,
and a string representing the browsers error message.

The posibilities are:
Aborted: The user aborted loading the video.
Network: A network error stopped the video from loading.
Decode: the browser is unable to decode this file.
Unsupported: the browser does not support playback of this file.

-}
type PlaybackError
    = Aborted String
    | Network String
    | Decode String
    | Unsupported String


{-| Represents the current status of playback in the Media Element.

Here are the possibilites:
Paused: Media is not playing (and not Ended)
Playing: Media is playing
Loading: Media is still loading, does not have enough data to start playing
Buffering: Media is buffering. Media is not playing
Ended: Media completed. Media is not playing
PlaybackError: Media has encountered a problem and is not playing.

-}
type PlaybackStatus
    = Paused
    | Playing
    | Loading
    | Buffering
    | Ended
    | PlaybackError PlaybackError


{-| Represents a more precise record of how much of the media file has been
loaded and is ready to play.

HaveNothing: No information about the media
HaveMetadata: Information about the media, but no meaningful stream data
HaveCurrentData: Data is available only for the current frame, not anything beyond that
HaveFutureData: Data for some, but not all, of the remaining stream is available (as little as two frames worth)
HaveEnoughData: Enough data to play media through to end without further buffering, if data bandwidth remains constant

-}
type ReadyState
    = HaveNothing
    | HaveMetadata
    | HaveCurrentData
    | HaveFutureData
    | HaveEnoughData


{-| The HTMLMediaElement loads its own resources (most of the time). This
type represents the state of it's network connection.

Empty: No data loaded or loading
Idle: Element has a resource, but is not currently loading it (possibly because it is finished loading in its entirety)
Loading: browser is downloading the media
NoSource: No valid source provided

-}
type NetworkState
    = Empty
    | Idle
    | DataLoading
    | NoSource


{-| This type represents a List TimeRange. A TimeRange is simply `{start: float, end: float}`.

This type is used to represent attributes about a timeline that have multiple value,
such as the sections of a media that have been played already.

This will always be a list.

NOTE: This cannot be used without adding an asArray property to the TimeRanges.prototype in javascript.
You can do so like this:
`if (!(TimeRanges.prototype.asArray)) {
Object.defineProperty(TimeRanges.prototype, "asArray", { get: function () { var arr = []; for (i = 0; i < this.length; i++) { arr.push({ start: this.start(i), end: this.end(i) }); }; return arr; } });
}`
or you can use function "modifyTimeRanges() in the file "Port/mediaPort.js."

-}
type alias TimeRanges =
    List Types.TimeRange


{-| Represents a subtitle, captions, or other synchronized text track.
-}
type alias TextTrack =
    { id : String
    , activeCues : List VTTCue
    , cues : List VTTCue
    , kind : TextTrackKind
    , inBandMetadataTrackDispatchType : String
    , label : String
    , language : String
    , mode : TextTrackMode
    }


{-| Represents the possible kinds of TextTrack.

If this module can't figure out what kind it is, it will produce an `Other String`,
with the string representing the kind attribute presented by the browser.

-}
type TextTrackKind
    = Captions
    | Chapters
    | Descriptions
    | Metadata
    | Subtitles
    | Other String
    | None


{-| Represents where the text track is currently Showing (active), Hidden (active but non-visible),
or Disabled (not active)
-}
type TextTrackMode
    = Disabled
    | Hidden
    | Showing


{-| Represents a single, WebVTT text cue. The structure looks like this:

`type alias VTTCue =
{ text : String
, startTime : Float
, endTime : Float`
}

-}
type alias VTTCue =
    Types.VTTCue

{-| Takes your state and returns a string representing it's id.

Since State and Id are both opaque types, this is the easiest way to
access the id of the media element.
